# Spark-Projects

## This will be a repo of a set of Spark Projects I work on to get more familiar using Spark. I will be using both Pyspark and RSpark



## How to get Started
#### To get started run the following commands:
#### Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv spark-venv
```
#### Activate the virtual environment and install the libraries
```
source spark-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
